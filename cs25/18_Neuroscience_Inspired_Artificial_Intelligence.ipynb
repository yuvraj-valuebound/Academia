        "\n",
        "The lecture posits that the heuristic softmax operation, a critical component of the Transformer architecture's attention mechanism, is not just a statistical convenience but has a deeper connection to the principles of associative memory. Specifically, it shows that the attention mechanism approximates the read operation of a Sparse Distributed Memory. This connection is established by demonstrating that the number of shared \"neurons\" (or vectors) in the intersection of two hyperspheres in a high-dimensional space—the core of SDM's retrieval process—decays approximately exponentially as the hyperspheres move apart. This exponential relationship mirrors the behavior of the softmax function, providing a theoretical and biologically plausible foundation for one of deep learning's most powerful tools. The lecture further suggests this link could explain why Transformers are so effective and points to the cerebellum as a potential site for a similar mechanism in the brain."
